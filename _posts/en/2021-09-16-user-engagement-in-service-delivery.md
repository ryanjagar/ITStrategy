Why do we create services?
There are many answers to this question, but the one I like is:

> To offer customers a solution that costs them less than the cost of the problem.

Services work when people use them, and when they work well, more people use them.
Users donâ€™t generally realize when service delivery is changing because they have grown up with the improvements being put in place, and have adjusted to the new norm in a natural way.
What has *not* changed is that when they *do* interact with a service, they want a **great** user experience.

The [GC Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) apply the mindset of providing public services to Canadians that are "simple to use".
To design "user-focused" products, the user should be involved in every aspect of the research to optimize the time and effort put into understanding its needs and problems.

We must design better products for citizens and public servant colleagues.
*Why?* Because "we" demand it.
Because a long-lasting, well-structured relationships is the secret ingredient to make users happy.

### Creating personas

In the IT Strategy team, we designed and implemented some products and, luckily, we had a chance to involve users throughout the design process as well as test our prototypes before launching.
Our first step was learning about users, their context, their objectives, and obstacles to inform our general direction.
We created personas to help us get to know our users, their behaviours, goals, frustrations, to understand who we are designing for, and if it meets the needs of our target audience.

This is what happened during the [DevOps Self-Assessment tool](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/devops-self-assessment.html) design sprint.
Based on research, we created fictional characters to help us understand the users we are designing for.
We discovered different types of users with their behaviour patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which they operate to see where we should focus and improve while designing our application.
The main user of the tool is a public servant in IITB looking to continuously improve and support the efforts of its peers.
By understanding the expectations, concerns, and motivations of our target users, we came up with a design-focused solution.
To design for a public servant while being public servants ourselves, it is so easy to create a self-referential product as if we are making the product only for us, when in fact the target audience may be quite unlike us.
We also created a mock-up which was recently presented to a real group of users in order to collect feedback for further improvement.

Thinking about the needs of our fictional â€“ end user persona, we tried to shape the product strategy and create the best mock-up for *him/her*.
It is worth mentioning that although user personas helped us to prioritize the features, it was not the only tool used for prioritization.
We were constantly collecting feedback from stakeholders to keep a proper balance between the needs of the business and the needs of the users, in order to create a solution that would satisfy both.
With the feedback received, we tried to iterate the overall experience for the user.

### Accessibility and multilingualism

In government, accessibility is an important part of the service design and should be considered throughout the whole process.
According to the [Accessible Canada Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada.html), programs and service delivery is one of the key areas where the Government of Canada should focus its efforts.
Another important area to consider in government is that citizens must be served in the official language of their choice.
By respecting the official language preferences of the Canadian public, we must design services to be bilingual (see [Official languages in communications and services to the public](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/values-ethics/official-languages/public-services.html)).
To produce better quality results, the user interface design of our services must follow the [Web Experience Toolkit](https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index-en.html) framework led by the Government of Canada.
It is a collaborative open source framework that covers the accessibility, usability, and multilingual aspects by providing reusable templates that help create an early model/sample prototype to test hypotheses.

### Usability test

To understand how real users interact with our application(s), we focused on creating a usability test plan.
The usability test plan is like a blueprint that contains information such as the methodology (a brief introduction on how the test will be conducted), moderator script (a script that a moderator follows, which consists of instructions, topics, and questions that will be used for all test sessions, to ensure consistency), task cases (a summary of what typical users might go through while using the product), and the schedule of the participants.

To determine how well our design/product works, we performed usability testing with several users.
This is a journey where results are not known in advance and can require time along with dealing with ambiguity.
But this journey is FUN! ðŸ™‚
The main purpose of this process is to evaluate the ideas and solutions we came up with, and identify what is working and what is not.
We tested our application and listened to our users to understand them.
**Listening to users is a tricky thing.
Users often donâ€™t know what they want, and even if they do, the communication is likely to get misinterpreted somewhere between the user and the moderator.**
To receive useful user feedback and correct information in the first place, we had to make sure, while preparing the moderator script, that we considered what exactly we want to test and then did it accordingly.
In this case, there is a big risk that the script will predispose the user to give specific feedback that will not be objective.
So, to design the best user experience, we mostly paid attention to what users do, not what they say, to avoid self-reported claims that are unreliable.

In the case of the [DevOps Self-Assessment tool](https://sara-sabr.github.io/auto-evaluation-devops-self-assessment/#/), we were testing usability issues of the website such as: layout issues, lack of feedback, confusing terminology, missing functionality (if the user can't perform a specific task due to a missing interface element), missing navigation (if the user gets stuck on a screen during the test), and the content of specific screens.
We were also asking users for general feedback on how useful they find the application, and how it can be improved.
We made sure the users knew what the prototype and test were about.
However, we did not over-explain how the prototype works or how it is supposed to solve usersâ€™ problems.
We let the users experiment with using the prototype speak for itself and observed their reactions.
We assured participants that during the session, we were testing the prototype, not the users; we explained that there are no right or wrong answers to the questions asked, and that any actions performed by them will help us fill up the gaps that we missed while designing the application.
We introduced the tasks, one at a time, and invited participants to "think out loud" to hear their concerns, opinions, and comments.
We asked users to talk through their experiences, as they are very important to consider while designing a product.

DevOps Self-Assessment usability testing during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted remotely.
Although the benefit of face-to-face contact was lost, we personally found it just as effective as traditional testing.
Remote online testing provides access to a larger pool of potential testers, cuts out travel time, and makes participants more flexible.
And most importantly, people complete tasks sitting at their home (i.e., a natural environment), where they will be using our final products.
Thus, the usability insights we gained from the tests were closer to the real world.

### Collecting feedback and implementing

While collecting feedback, it is very important to not disrupt the userâ€™s interaction with the prototype.
We had to find a way to collect feedback in a way that allowed us to freely observe what was happening.
In this case, with the user's permission, we chose to use the screen recording feature of MS Teams and recorded each session.
It was the easiest way to capture the user's thoughts and motions during the session.
Digital video is a very useful output of usability testing sessions that clearly shows user interaction with elements on the screen.
We discussed and tested our product with approximately 6-7 users, which was enough to understand what needs to be improved and considered before making changes to the product.

During the usability testing, we received an overwhelming amount of user feedback.
Every user was different and was able to provide different types of valuable information.
The main trick was to make a distinction between user preference/desire and user needs.
Implementing more of the userâ€™s desire can complicate and increase the weight of the product so much that some users, who were prompted to use features, would prefer not to use the final product.
It is very important to differentiate between them and not evaluate too quickly each point of feedback.
Some suggestions may not be beneficial to the product, and as a result, we needed to be strategic about what feedback to take action on.

To use the results, it was important to not exaggerate or add to what was seen or heard.
To capture the results accurately, we mapped specific feedback to our research questions, identified which questions were answered and which were not, and what new questions may have come up.
To do this, we prioritized the user feedback and comments received in a backlog before each iteration's planning meeting, to ensure that the prioritization was correct.

### User experience never ends

User experience does not stop here.
All the effort spent planning, researching, and creating the product led us to the launch phase.
But then, we still need to invest time in post-launch production to ensure we created a product users can benefit from.
So after the launch, the optimization phase begins.
Once users get their hands on the product, we might see, through data and user behaviour, that a lot of our initial assumptions are false or that the users use our product in unexpected ways.
We are still monitoring user experience of each of our products by asking users to share their feedback.
And this is where another whole phase of user experience starts.

*Did I mention user experience is a never-ending process?*
