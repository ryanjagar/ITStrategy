Since our last status update, the [Micro-Acquisition website](https://micro-acquisition.alpha.canada.ca/en/index.html) went live and the [first opportunity](https://micro-acquisition.alpha.canada.ca/2021/06/23/building-custom-Azure-marketplace-policies.html) was posted.

As part of the Micro-Acquisition pilot we are trying things, learning and adjusting as we go.
In preparation for the next opportunity we have made a few changes based on what we learned from the first opportunity.

## Added a mailing list

When we didn't get a lot of followers on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/microbuysgc), we did some testing and realized 2 things:

1. It wasn't clear what information would be found by following the Twitter account and
2. A lot of our target audience is not on Twitter

We now have a mailing list that anyone can subscribe to.
Through the [mailing list](https://forms-formulaires.alpha.canada.ca/id/36) (and Twitter) we will be sharing when new opportunities are posted and/or updated. We also updated the text on the opportunities page to be more clear what information is available via the Twitter account and mailing list.

## Updated evaluation question

Our first opportunity was for a less well-known language (Powershell).
We realized from the applications we received that there were people who likely could do the work but the phrasing of our evaluation criteria prevented us from giving them a pass because they didn't have experience specifically in Powershell.
Where possible, future opportunities will see the evaluation criteria change from:
> Please provide a short written statement demonstrating how you have the required skills in x

to

> Please provide a short written statement demonstrating how you have the required skills in x or a similar language.

We've also added [example answers which would get a passing mark](https://micro-acquisition.alpha.canada.ca/en/user-guide.html#example-answers-that-would-get-a-passing-mark) to the User Guide.

## Using GC Forms for the application form

We are replacing our pdf application form with a form on [GC Forms](https://forms-formulaires.alpha.canada.ca/en/welcome-bienvenue).
GC Forms is a CDS product and it is accessible, secure and has full authority to operate.
GC Forms is a service - you tell CDS your need, they build your form, test it and then send you the link.

IT IS GREAT.

We are excited because not only will we no longer have to maintain a pdf form, but user experience for suppliers will be improved as the form will tell them if they have missed filling something in.
It also means that we'll receive application information as structured data so we will be able to automate the application form processing.

That's it for our updates for now! Stay tuned for opportunity #2!
