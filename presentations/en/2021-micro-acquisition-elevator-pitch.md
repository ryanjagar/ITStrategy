# Micro-Acquisition Pilot

ESDC IT Strategy Team

Note:

- we are here today to talk to you about our procurement pilot and we will
- but first we want to talk a little about what we believe

---

Trying to continuously improve while also keeping the lights on is hard

Note:

---

Learning new things is essential to keep up with the fast pace of IT

Note:

(and we know that learning often takes a back seat to operational activities)

---

Sharing code across teams, branches and departments can free up valuable time

Note:

- reduce duplication
- participate in a community
- OSS code is more secure

---

IT contract dollars going to the same usual suspects reduces our exposure to new ideas

Note:

---

There is a vast amount of IT talent out there for whom a $10K contract would mean a whole lot

Note:

Fix everything with procurement!

Note:

- joking. This is a complex problem with multiple solutions contribution to moving us forward.
- Outsourcing large IT solutions has a problematic track record
- We are not pro-outsourcing all things.
- Phoenix, canada.ca email examples of outsourcing gone wrong for many reasons
- but we believe there is a strong benefit to outsourcing when keeping the lights on means that issues that remain stuck in the backlog, or when having no time to learn new skills prevents moving towards modern approaches.
- procurement could be one piece of the puzzle.

- procurement of custom code
- licenced as open source
- <$10K
- no security clearance required
- work done in the open
- paid by credit card

Note:

- so we want to introduce you to the micro-acquisition pilot
- this is a procurement option developed in partnership between IITB and CFOB
- through this option you can procure custom code and only custom code (think automation scripts, accessibility and bug fixes, small add/on modules, data analysis). The code that is delivered must be licenced as open source and the total value of the contract must be less than $10K including taxes. The work is all done on open repositories
- suppliers face reduced barriers because they do not require a security clearance and qualification does not require business income in the millions nor proof of work of other contracts

We are reducing risk through:

- code acceptance criteria
- taking lessons from others who have done this
- partnership with CFOB

Note:

- before we finish i want to talk briefly about how we are reducing risk
- opportunity statement must include the tests we will be doing on the code to ensure it meets functional requirements as well as quality and security requirements
- can't overstate the importance of having CFOB (in particular the procurement innovation team) as our partners in this. simply put they made all the key pieces happen like getting the legal framework in place as well as the payment by credit card. We are so glad to be working on this with them.
