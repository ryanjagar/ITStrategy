Vendor, SI, Internal, etc. (see presentation for disambiguation about possibilities; not addressing directly **how**)\r\n- Contractual obligations:\r\n  - How do we ensure that we have the right contractual clauses in acquisition process to support loose coupling and maintaining models (long term contract with X means can't make changes to arch until end date, increases complexity of aligning various initiatives with ensuring support agreements, etc.) \r\n- Regarding reducing risks related to COTS product: introduce notion that there are specialized solutions vs generic solutions\r\n  -  Argument is that companies that have invested in niche markets have knowledge that org may not have, worked with many organizations to improve the \"domain\" so are more likely to add value.\r\n- General comment on document: \r\n - what the intent is vs how people will interpret it is most likely an issue --> need to make it easily understandable, no place for interpretation (use decision trees, checklists, official framework, etc.)\r\n - Document (mainly section on **measures for success**) is very IT focused, would help to align to Business outcomes instead",

    "body": "**Known reporting needs:**\r\n_Regular:_\r\n- Weekly report to Senior Director: excel spreadsheet report populated manually by manager based on info in the Kanban board. Each team reporting to the senior director has their own tab.  On the IT Strategy tab there is one row for each the team's main deliverables. Report data includes: project/deliverable name, start date, end date, names of the main team members working on that project/deliverable, then a free text field listing updates on that item of relevance to the SD.  Note this report is currently under review (opportunity to influence?). As part of the changes from this review the start and end dates are expected to change from dates to quarters\r\n- Monthly reporting for lite projects: Only required for the micro-acquisition pilot (assuming it gets approved). Still learning about these requirements but it looks like for each lite project, monthly updates are required on: all financials, expected completion date and red/yellow/green for health, scope, cost, sched, risks, issues. Preliminary investigations indicate that this information is pulled from PMIS which we will have to update manually.\r\n- MAF: yearly? unknown information/granularity requirements\r\n\r\n_Ad hoc:_\r\n- The roadmap (from the planning powerpoint file) was provided as part of the briefing binder for the new DG. It visually depicts each of the team's main deliverables showing the start/end (time to complete). This is a high level report with no detailed activity information.\r\n- acting DG requested a report showing what the team was working on for the 'next few months'. High level report was provided. Not sure exactly what data was in the report\r\n\r\n**Unknown reporting needs:**\r\nYep. ;-)\r\n\r\n**Other points to note:**\r\n- reporting required for the micro-acquisition project may need to be to a greater level due to the anticipated scrutiny that could come from being high profile.\r\n- need to translate what we are doing into reportable chunks (that fit in with departmental reporting)\r\n- need to demonstrate team value/PR\r\n- more granular more options?",

The new model will look at Governance, Finance, Architecture, Product Management, and DevOps as means to accelerate the delivery of IT solutions / ................................ edit milestone to read more because GitHub does not format milestone description...................................... / \r\n\r\nThe purpose is to provide IITB with two different models to release IT solutions:\r\n\r\nA- the current one (conventional). Difficult to change due to the size of the organization and criticality of systems\r\nB- an alternate one (this strategy). Where new projects willing could leverage, and demonstrate whether or not this new way of delivering IT solutions is better than the conventional way.\r\n\r\nThe Strategy will [comprise of two things](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/ApproachToStrategy.md):\r\n\r\n1- A guiding policy\r\n2- A set of coherent actions (an action plan, things that need to be adjusted for the new Model to be operational)\r\n\r\nThe strategy is expected to involve the following stakeholders for contribution, endorsement, and potential approvals (some may be outside of CIO's influence):\r\n\r\n- Enterprise Architecture\r\n- PMO\r\n- Technical Debt\r\n- Senior Advisors (AppDev and IT Security)\r\n- IT Security\r\n- CFOB\r\n\r\nThe Strategy is expected to involve the following 7 items from the [Strategy Map](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-summary.html):\r\n\r\n- Continuous Improvement\r\n- Meaningful work\r\n- Continuous Integration\r\n- Lean Architecture\r\n- Automated Deployments\r\n- Lean Change Approval\r\n- Cross Functional Teams",

The new model will look at Governance, Finance, Architecture, Product Management, and DevOps as means to accelerate the delivery of IT solutions / ................................ edit milestone to read more because GitHub does not format milestone description...................................... / \r\n\r\nThe purpose is to provide IITB with two different models to release IT solutions:\r\n\r\nA- the current one (conventional). Difficult to change due to the size of the organization and criticality of systems\r\nB- an alternate one (this strategy). Where new projects willing could leverage, and demonstrate whether or not this new way of delivering IT solutions is better than the conventional way.\r\n\r\nThe Strategy will [comprise of two things](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/ApproachToStrategy.md):\r\n\r\n1- A guiding policy\r\n2- A set of coherent actions (an action plan, things that need to be adjusted for the new Model to be operational)\r\n\r\nThe strategy is expected to involve the following stakeholders for contribution, endorsement, and potential approvals (some may be outside of CIO's influence):\r\n\r\n- Enterprise Architecture\r\n- PMO\r\n- Technical Debt\r\n- Senior Advisors (AppDev and IT Security)\r\n- IT Security\r\n- CFOB\r\n\r\nThe Strategy is expected to involve the following 7 items from the [Strategy Map](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-summary.html):\r\n\r\n- Continuous Improvement\r\n- Meaningful work\r\n- Continuous Integration\r\n- Lean Architecture\r\n- Automated Deployments\r\n- Lean Change Approval\r\n- Cross Functional Teams",

They should now look similar to articles on [Medium.com](https://medium.com) for example.\r\n\r\nOne exception is the tables. I've found that making them more narrow would hurt readability, so I left them wide (but they'll auto resize according to their content).\r\n\r\nFinally, I've also set the text size a bit bigger to 20px.\r\n\r\nI'm not an UI/UX specialist so let me know if we need to tweak these changes. Also, I'm sure there are more elegant ways to code this so I'm open to any suggestions :)",

The new model will look at Governance, Finance, Architecture, Product Management, and DevOps as means to accelerate the delivery of IT solutions / ................................ edit milestone to read more because GitHub does not format milestone description...................................... / \r\n\r\nThe purpose is to provide IITB with two different models to release IT solutions:\r\n\r\nA- the current one (conventional). Difficult to change due to the size of the organization and criticality of systems\r\nB- an alternate one (this strategy). Where new projects willing could leverage, and demonstrate whether or not this new way of delivering IT solutions is better than the conventional way.\r\n\r\nThe Strategy will [comprise of two things](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/ApproachToStrategy.md):\r\n\r\n1- A guiding policy\r\n2- A set of coherent actions (an action plan, things that need to be adjusted for the new Model to be operational)\r\n\r\nThe strategy is expected to involve the following stakeholders for contribution, endorsement, and potential approvals (some may be outside of CIO's influence):\r\n\r\n- Enterprise Architecture\r\n- PMO\r\n- Technical Debt\r\n- Senior Advisors (AppDev and IT Security)\r\n- IT Security\r\n- CFOB\r\n\r\nThe Strategy is expected to involve the following 7 items from the [Strategy Map](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-summary.html):\r\n\r\n- Continuous Improvement\r\n- Meaningful work\r\n- Continuous Integration\r\n- Lean Architecture\r\n- Automated Deployments\r\n- Lean Change Approval\r\n- Cross Functional Teams",

The new model will look at Governance, Finance, Architecture, Product Management, and DevOps as means to accelerate the delivery of IT solutions / ................................ edit milestone to read more because GitHub does not format milestone description...................................... / \r\n\r\nThe purpose is to provide IITB with two different models to release IT solutions:\r\n\r\nA- the current one (conventional). Difficult to change due to the size of the organization and criticality of systems\r\nB- an alternate one (this strategy). Where new projects willing could leverage, and demonstrate whether or not this new way of delivering IT solutions is better than the conventional way.\r\n\r\nThe Strategy will [comprise of two things](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/ApproachToStrategy.md):\r\n\r\n1- A guiding policy\r\n2- A set of coherent actions (an action plan, things that need to be adjusted for the new Model to be operational)\r\n\r\nThe strategy is expected to involve the following stakeholders for contribution, endorsement, and potential approvals (some may be outside of CIO's influence):\r\n\r\n- Enterprise Architecture\r\n- PMO\r\n- Technical Debt\r\n- Senior Advisors (AppDev and IT Security)\r\n- IT Security\r\n- CFOB\r\n\r\nThe Strategy is expected to involve the following 7 items from the [Strategy Map](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-summary.html):\r\n\r\n- Continuous Improvement\r\n- Meaningful work\r\n- Continuous Integration\r\n- Lean Architecture\r\n- Automated Deployments\r\n- Lean Change Approval\r\n- Cross Functional Teams",

    "body": "_Goal_: Produce a presentation for ARC and SLF on what it means to do Loose Coupling Architecture \r\n\r\n_Purpose_: Inform and Educate the audience on the **rapid elasticity** capability of cloud technologies and the compromise of increased data management complexity (e.g. micro services) for a greater autonomy to IT Products / Teams\r\n\r\n_This idea's background_: After peer reviewing the Target IT Solution Delivery Model, hearing the interoperability team struggle in convincing others to move towards APIs and use of containers, I get the impression that loose coupling is misunderstood or simply not believed in. E.g. \"I get loose coupling, but no IT product can be independent from each other. You will always have dependencies.\". This may be true in a legacy environment that is Monolith in nature and cannot rapidly scale but in with cloud technologies and proper data management capabilities (e.g. event based messaging, caching, synchronization) it can be.\r\n\r\n_Topics to cover in the presentation_: \r\n  - Demystify Loose Coupling. IT Products **can** run independently in production. Even if those IT Products get their data from a other source (e.g. PeopleSoft get their data from Phoenix. When Phoenix goes down, PeopleSodt keeps running).\r\n  - Accept greater data management complexity. Data will be duplicated and distributed. This tradeoff to allow more autonomy and speed for change. \r\n  - Rapid Elasticity of cloud allows IT products to scale, on demand, to supply requests in a timely manner\r\n  - Caching capabilities are expected to reduce latency \r\n\r\n_Needs Contributions from_:\r\n  - Solutions Architecture team (member of ARC)\r\n  - Interopery team (member of ARC, and QA for APIs to be published on the GC API store)\r\n  - Cloud CoE (for support and credibility if we talk Cloud)\r\n  - CDO (because data management)",

The new model will look at Governance, Finance, Architecture, Product Management, and DevOps as means to accelerate the delivery of IT solutions / ................................ edit milestone to read more because GitHub does not format milestone description...................................... / \r\n\r\nThe purpose is to provide IITB with two different models to release IT solutions:\r\n\r\nA- the current one (conventional). Difficult to change due to the size of the organization and criticality of systems\r\nB- an alternate one (this strategy). Where new projects willing could leverage, and demonstrate whether or not this new way of delivering IT solutions is better than the conventional way.\r\n\r\nThe Strategy will [comprise of two things](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/ApproachToStrategy.md):\r\n\r\n1- A guiding policy\r\n2- A set of coherent actions (an action plan, things that need to be adjusted for the new Model to be operational)\r\n\r\nThe strategy is expected to involve the following stakeholders for contribution, endorsement, and potential approvals (some may be outside of CIO's influence):\r\n\r\n- Enterprise Architecture\r\n- PMO\r\n- Technical Debt\r\n- Senior Advisors (AppDev and IT Security)\r\n- IT Security\r\n- CFOB\r\n\r\nThe Strategy is expected to involve the following 7 items from the [Strategy Map](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-summary.html):\r\n\r\n- Continuous Improvement\r\n- Meaningful work\r\n- Continuous Integration\r\n- Lean Architecture\r\n- Automated Deployments\r\n- Lean Change Approval\r\n- Cross Functional Teams",

Difficult to change due to the size of the organization and criticality of systems\r\nB- an alternate one (this strategy). Where new projects willing could leverage, and demonstrate whether or not this new way of delivering IT solutions is better than the conventional way.\r\n\r\nThe Strategy will [comprise of two things](https://github.com/sara-sabr/ITStrategy/blob/master/wip-tec/en/ApproachToStrategy.md):\r\n\r\n1- A guiding policy\r\n2- A set of coherent actions (an action plan, things that need to be adjusted for the new Model to be operational)\r\n\r\nThe strategy is expected to involve the following stakeholders for contribution, endorsement, and potential approvals (some may be outside of CIO's influence):\r\n\r\n- Enterprise Architecture\r\n- PMO\r\n- Technical Debt\r\n- Senior Advisors (AppDev and IT Security)\r\n- IT Security\r\n- CFOB\r\n\r\nThe Strategy is expected to involve the following 7 items from the [Strategy Map](https://sara-sabr.github.io/ITStrategy/strategy-summary.html):\r\n\r\n- Continuous Improvement\r\n- Meaningful work\r\n- Continuous Integration\r\n- Lean Architecture\r\n- Automated Deployments\r\n- Lean Change Approval\r\n- Cross Functional Teams",

This would then let IITB managers a way to find expertise, making it easier to allow micro-missions, and allow employees greater mobility and exposure.\r\n\r\nThe current program doesn't seem to be automated enough where HR no longer had the capacity to support it. It may not have been adequately broadcasted enough, or intuitive as well to be fully used.\r\n\r\nAt first, it sounds similar to the [GCConnex Career Marketplace](https://gcconnex.gc.ca/missions/main). \r\n\r\n_Proposal_\r\n\r\n- Evaluate IITB HR's SEED program with that of [GCConnex Career Marketplace](https://gcconnex.gc.ca/missions/main) for similarities and gaps (to justify whether to use GCConnex or not)\r\n- Build a SEED web application to sustain the SEED program without administrative burdens and make it intuitive for users (managers and employees)\r\n",

    "body": "Following blog post #469 , I'd like us to tackle the saying that Government is not in the software business, a recurring theme where we should not develop software but rather have private sector bid in offering us their commoditized solutions.\r\n\r\nKey concepts:\r\n- Software is not a building\r\n  - As stated in previous blog, we have been building houses and large building for centuries and have acquired a know-how\r\n  - But even if information technology is a relatively new concept that evolves at an increasingly higher speed, the real differentiator with the skyscraper analogy is that software is intangible, immaterial.\r\n  - Large informations systems are definitely complicated but given our methods of governance based on managing physical assets, we don't reap the full benefits of this intangible nature of software.\r\n- Software is the executable version (compiled/interpreted) of the program's source code which in turn is the translation of an algorithm written in human readable language into a structured language. An algorithm is a series of reproducible steps, a process...\r\n- Governments are bureaucratic organizations, putting in place policies, directives and guidelines in line with laws and programs developed by elected officials, then establishing and continuously improving processes to ensure expectable results to apply said programs and laws. They are essentially designing algorithms.\r\n- When someone says that Government is not in the software business, what is meant by that is that we are not meant to build software but rather offer citizens services. The software should be bought from software companies.\r\n\r\nArgument: \r\nGovernment is not in the software business, it is in the business of offering vital services to its citizens, driven by the democratic process. However, in order to provide services to citizens, Government now needs to be able to design and build software solutions as a way to meet the needs of its citizens that now live in a Digital world, no matter where they may be.\r\n\r\nThis requires platforms provided for all business lines, multidisciplinary teams that shift from project to products/services (see IT Picture Medium/Long term).\r\n\r\nProcurement of commoditized software components is acceptable as long as said components are fully interoperable, interchangeable and can be executed on any runtime, whether that is a public cloud service provider or on-premise.\r\n",

War & Peace & IT \r\n    - The current process is very tedious and time consuming, leading to ideas being dismissed\r\n    - A project done in silo without reusability of its components in mind can lead to waste.
